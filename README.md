# Minecraft tag plugin
This plugin allows you to play a game of tag in Minecraft.
## How does it work?
* First, you have to choose the location where the game will take place. Then you can type the command "/tagstart \<player\>" to start the game. You will be the hunter, and the specified player will be the victim.
* The game takes place in a 100 by 100 block area. Both the hunter and the victim will be given basic items to help them achieve their objectives. The hunter will additionally receive a tracking compass that will point at the victim's location when the hunter presses the right mouse button with it in hand.
* If the hunter hits his opponent in two minutes, he wins. If he can't do that, the victim wins
